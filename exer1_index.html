            <p>FAVORITE CMSC SUBJECT AND WHY: Out of all the CMSC courses that I’ve taken, my favorite is CMSC 150: Numerical and Symbolic Computation, specifically the Laboratory component of it, as using R as the programming language was relatively easy to pick up. This is thanks to previous CMSC courses that I’ve taken as it helped me grasp the R language with ease. </p>
            <p>FAVORITE GE SO FAR AND WHY: Out of all the General Education (GE) courses that I’ve taken, COMM 10: Critical Perspectives in Communication stood out the most, as it focused on helping students like me understand communication in a deeper sense by teaching the course concepts and theories using current events and personal experiences. Also, this is the first course in UPLB where I received my first flat uno. :)</p>
            <p>FAVORITE PL AND WHY:If I have to choose I’d say it’s between Python and Java as of the moment. I picked Python because out of all the programming languages that I’ve used its syntax is the most readable and easy to use. It is also the first language that I’ve learned. I also chose Java because this is the programming language that I utilized to learn Object Oriented Programming and I also liked the idea that you can create classes and packages which makes sorting code somewhat easier. </p>
            <p>FAVORITE FOOD: Fried chicken! No need for discussion.</p>
            <!--others-->
            <p>HOBBIES: Playing online games, watching series, films and TV shows,  and sleeping. </p>
            <p>CHILDHOOD DREAM: Anything that involves creating something (i.e. Engineer, Architect) </p>
